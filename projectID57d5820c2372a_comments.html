<HTML><BODY>A book introducing Children to Greek life from a child's perspective. From the same series and similar in format to the book on Armenia (Archag The Little Armenian) that went through the rounds before.

<p>No difficulties expected, except for one line of Greek in Greek script, which can be treated in the normal way.

<p>Have Fun!
